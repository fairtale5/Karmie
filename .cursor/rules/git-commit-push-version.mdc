When making a git commit, always follow these steps:
1. Stage all files, not just some files ALL FILES using git add .
2. Check git status to be sure: git status
3. Check all files for changes, look at the code changes.
4. Write an overview of all changes to a documment in root called /git-message.txt
5. Commit using /git-message.txt you created.
6. Push to github
7. Delete the /git-message.txt

Template for /git-message.txt:

Overview:
Explain what we were trying to solve, and how we solved it.

Changed files:
List all the files that changed, like:
- /folder/filename.ext
- /folder/folder.filename.ext

Details:
List again all files, but this time add a list of bullets to each, explaining what changed, like:
- /folder/filename.ext - changed variable X to Y to solve Z.
- /folder/folder/filename.ext - changed function X and replaced it with Y, so now when ... happens it now does .... instead of ... This change solves the issue we were having with...

Conclusion:
- Add tests, what did we test and know is working? Is there anything we should still test before making the commit?
