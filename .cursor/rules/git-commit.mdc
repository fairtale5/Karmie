git commits should always:
- check if all files are staged, and either stage them or warn if not all files are staged for commit.
- check what files, and which code changed since the last commit, by checking the lines of code changed.
- write a logn commit message into commit_message.txt
- use that file to commit the latest changes
- delete the file afterwards
- push the changes to github
