question: i sometimes get confused about the collection names.

users
votes -> the votes
tags -> categories for each existing reputation
reputations -> the individual user reputations


would this be better:
users
votes -> the votes
reputations -> call it reputations instead of tags. each reputation is a tag.
reputations_users -> call it reputation_users instead of reputations, since it is the individual user reputations in that reputation?
