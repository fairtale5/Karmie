# Tag Search Improvements

## Current Implementation
- Currently using `listDocs` to fetch all tags, which is inefficient for large collections
- No caching of tag data
- No pagination or limiting of results
- No sorting of user's most active tags

## Required Improvements

### 1. Tag Data Fetching
- [ ] Implement pagination for tag listing
- [ ] Add caching layer for frequently accessed tags
- [ ] Consider implementing a tag index collection for faster searches
- [ ] Add rate limiting for tag queries

### 2. User Tag Suggestions
- [ ] Use `queryDocsByKey` to fetch user's reputation documents
- [ ] Sort reputation documents by score to find top tags
- [ ] Cache user's top tags to avoid frequent queries
- [ ] Implement background refresh of user's top tags

### 3. Search Optimization
- [ ] Implement server-side filtering for tag search
- [ ] Add debouncing for search input
- [ ] Consider implementing a search index
- [ ] Add fuzzy search capabilities

### 4. Performance Considerations
- [ ] Monitor query performance
- [ ] Implement query timeouts
- [ ] Add error handling for failed queries
- [ ] Consider implementing a tag cache service

## Implementation Notes
- Current implementation uses `listDocs` which loads all tags into memory
- Need to switch to `queryDocsByKey` for more efficient filtering
- Consider implementing a tag service to handle all tag-related operations
- May need to implement a background job to pre-compute user's top tags
